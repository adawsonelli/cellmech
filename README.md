requires numpy, scipy for running simulations
requires mayavi for visualizing simulation results

Implementation of model for cell-resolved, multiparticle model of plastic tissue deformations and morphogenesis
first suggested by Czirok et al in 2014 (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1478-3975/12/1/016005/meta)
and first implemented in https://github.com/aczirok/cellmech.

Code contains extensions by Moritz Zeidler, Dept. for Innovative Methods of Computing (IMC), Centre for Information 
Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH) at Technische Universitaet Dresden. Code introduces substrate nodes. 
Substrate nodes behave like tissue nodes, but can only form links with other tissue nodes. They have three rotational,
but no translational degrees of freedom.
